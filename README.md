# DEEPROAD SAFETY

This project aims to build a mobile application that predicts the likelihood of traffic accidents in real time. By leveraging machine learning and historical data, the app can assist drivers in making safer travel decisions and avoiding accident-prone areas.

This application is to improve road safety through data-driven insights. The system analyzes traffic accident history, real-time weather data, and road congestion to estimate the risk of accidents at specific locations and times. Based on the predictions, it provides alerts and safer route recommendations to users.
